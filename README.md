# ParallelPanelVAR
Functions to parallelize the computational demanding functions of the panelvar package. These functions are only extensions to the work done by Sigmund and Ferstl (2018).
The binary code can be found on their researchgate website at https://www.researchgate.net/project/Panel-Vector-Autoregression-Models-with-different-GMM-estimators

Initially only the bootstrapping procedure for the impulse response functions is parallelized in order to facilitate its calculation.


The speed improvements are quite considerable and the results should be the same.
